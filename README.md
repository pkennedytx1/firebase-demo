# Firebase Demo

Firebase is a great way to get your feet wet with the whole serverless arch thing. It does require some setup, but once you have the connections and api keys the implementation is straight forward.

## Setup
You have to have a google account to use this. You will just google firebase and go to the console. Then you will setup a new project, and you can use this one as refrence to where the credentials will go that they throw at you. Please utilize the ENV files for your parameters so you don't get in trouble with Google. You can easily deploy apps using firebase, you will also need to upgrade to the pay as you go, you can have it alert you when money exceeds a provided value. The documentation is REALLY good so if you go slow and steady through the documentation you will have minimal barriers to get across. This is also widely used so there are alot of help docs.

## Running locally
```
npm install
npm start
```
